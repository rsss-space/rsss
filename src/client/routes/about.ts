                <p>
                    RSSS is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">
                    RSS/Atom</a> feed reader. It lets you subscribe
                    to feeds and read them in one place. You can
                    sign in with a <a href="https://bsky.app/">
                        Bluesky
                    </a> account.

                    This depends on${NBSP}
                    <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/">
                        Cloudflare Durable Objects
                    </a>. Each user gets their own Durable Object
                    with a SQLite database. This stores your
                    feeds, read/starred states, and
                    handles periodic feed fetching.

                <p>
                    The server polls the feeds you are subscribed to
                    (about once an hour) to check for new items.

                    Upgrade and pay $10 per month to get offline-first
                    reading. Choose which feeds are cached to your local
                    machine, so you can read them without an internet connection.

                <h2>Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Your feeds and reading history are private
                    to you. The only data shared is what's
                    necessary for Bluesky OAuth. Feed content
                    is fetched server-side, so the websites
                    you subscribe to don't see your IP address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that nothing here is encrypted.
                    You <em>are</em> taking it at my word that
                    I am not reading your RSS subscription
                    data, and no one at Cloudflare is either.
